This repository contains driver for Tridium Niagara 4 integration with SMSEagle Hardware SMS Gateway.

This driver allows you sending of SMS alarm messages, wake-up calls (ring only) and voice calls (text-to-speech) via TCP/IP from Tridium Supervisor 4, JACE8000, or JACE9000 stations. The driver uses SMSEagle hardware with a SIM card inside. SMSEagle is an offline hardware SMS gateway. All alarms are generated on-premise and sent directly to a cellular network. This solution can be used in secure installations without Internet access.
